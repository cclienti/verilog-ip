\section{Description}
\subsection{Architecture}

A router is made of full-duplex ports which rely on ingress and egress interfaces and that are respectively plugged to
egress and ingress of another router ports. Each router has its own clock domains and the crossing rely on dual-clocked
FIFO at the input of each ingress interface. A node is attached to a router using a local interface, this interface
instantiates an extra FIFO to the egress output to support the node's clock domain.

Figure \ref{hynoc_noc_overview} shows both internal organization of 5-port routers and how they are connected to their
neighbors.

\end{figure}

The router is a full crossbar, meaning that each ports can establish a communication to all ports except with
itself. Multiple paths inside the router can be opened at the same time thanks to the distributed arbitration
scheme. Thus, each egress port embeds an output multiplexer and an arbiter to route, without starvation, data from the
ingress ports that has requested a transfer.

Figure \ref{hynoc_router_data_arch} presents the data paths between ingress and egress. Each ingress broadcasts its
data to all egress ports except to the one which is grouped in the same router port. Then, the egress will forward data
to the next router depending on the request asserted by the ingress ports and also depending on the state of the
arbiter.

  \label{hynoc_router_data_arch}
\end{figure}

The control path is shown in the figure \ref{hynoc_router_control_arch}. Contrary to the data path structure, there
is no broadcast of control signals. Each ingress has dedicated links with each egress to assert transmit requests and to
receive the grant from an egress. Once the grand is received, the ingress can push data.

\end{figure}

The egress arbiter uses a parallel round-robin arbiter which allows to schedule all ingress requests without starvation
in a fix latency.

\section{First Layer Protocol}

\subsection{Packet routing}

HyNoC uses source routing techniques to send data through routers. Instead of addressing node with coordinates, for
instance (x,y) for a network with a mesh topology, we define in the packet's header the route to take through the
network. This means that the header contains a list of output ports, called hops, of routers to cross. This technique
is used by \cite{LIW2007} and \cite{MUB2010} to avoid congestion with a low packet header overhead using a simple encoding hop
scheme.

A routing algorithm can be defined upon Source Routing network depending on topology. \cite{MUB2010} survey presents such a
technique. The routing algorithm generates for each communication the list of hops either dynamically (in hardware in
the local interface or in software using the node's processor) or statically at compilation time.

Routes are established in a distributed way in each router, this technique is presented by \cite{PON2011}. Each egress
interface manage itself and it is in charge of selecting the right ingress interface using a simple request/acknowledge
protocol. Moreover, the egress interface embeds a LUT-based parallel round robin arbiter to respond in fix amount of
time without creating any starvation.


\subsection{Packet structure}

A packet is composed of multiple flits, a flit is the smallest unit transmitted over the network and it is composed of
$K+1$ bits. The most significant bit is the last bit and it indicates the last flit of a packet.

The table \ref{packet_definition} shows the packet structure. A packet is built with at least one Routing flit followed
by at least one Payload flit. If multiple header flits are used to encode the path through the network, the router will
consider only the first flit as a header and the remaining flits as payload. When all hops of the header are marked
used, that header flit will not be forwarded to the next router. Thus, the next router will use the next flit as a
header flit and so on.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c | c | c}
    \toprule\hline
    \textbf{Last bit} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{payload (K bits)}} \\
    \hline\hline
    0 & 4-bit Proto & Routing flit \\
    \hline
    0 & ... & ... \\
    \hline
    0 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Payload flit} \\
    \hline
    0 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{...} \\
    \hline
    1 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{last Payload flit} \\
    \hline\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{packet_definition} Packet definition}
\end{table}


The table \ref{smallest_packet} presents the smallest packet that can be sent over the network. The number of router
that it can pass through depends on the protocol, the payload width and the number of ports within a router.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c | c | c}
    \toprule\hline
    \textbf{Last flit bit} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{payload (K bits)}} \\
    \hline\hline
    0 & 4-bit Proto & Routing flit \\
    \hline
    1 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{last Payload flit} \\
    \hline\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{smallest_packet} Smallest packet}
\end{table}


\subsection{Routing protocols}

Multiple protocols can be supported in a routing flit depending on the 4-bit Proto value. The table
\ref{supported_protocol} shows supported protocols and the following sub-sections describe how they work.


\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l | c}
    \toprule\hline
    \textbf{Proto value} & \textbf{Routing method} \\
    \hline\hline
    4'b0000 & Unicast Circuit Switch \\
    \hline
    4'b0001 & Multicast Circuit Switch \\
    % 4'b1000 & XY routing\\
    \hline\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{supported_protocol} Supported routing protocols}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Unicast Circuit Switch routing}

In this routing policy, the routing flit is a list of router egress ID to cross. The table
\ref{unicast_circuit_switch_field} describes the unicast circuit switch protocol field. For a router with P ports, the
Hop field is encoded using $W=\lceil \log_2(P-1)\rceil$ bits. The index field points the correct hop to be used by the
router ingress port. The Gap width can be in $[0, W-1]$.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c | c | c | c | c | c}
    \toprule
    \hline
    \textbf{Proto} & \multicolumn{5}{c}{\textbf{Hops list (K-4 bits)}} \\
    \hline\hline
    4'b0000 & Gap & Hop H-1 & ... & Hop 0 & Index \\
    \hline
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{unicast_circuit_switch_field} Unicast Circuit Switch Field Description}
\end{table}

The index is numbered between $[0, H-1]$ for a flit with $H$ hops and is initialized to $H-1$. The index is decremented
once the pointed hop is used to open the path inside the router. If the index is null before path opening, the related
Network Hops flit will not be transmitted to the router's egress port, else the index is decremented and the updated
Routing flit is transmitted. A unicast flit can embed less than the maximum allowed number of hop fields by just
initializing the index accordingly.

The hop encoding is based upon the fact that a same packet can not use the same port for incoming and outgoing. The
number of accessible egress port are $P-1$ for a router with $P$ ports. This technique reduces the internal router's
crossbar size.

The figure \ref{hynoc_hops_encoding} shows the hops list $0 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$ to
establish a communication channel from node $(0, 0)$ to node $(2,2)$ in a $3 \times 3$ mesh network. This NoC is built
upon 5-port routers and only two bits are needed to encode each hop.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/hynoc_hops_encoding.pdf}
  \caption{Unicast Circuit Switch hops encoding}
  \label{hynoc_hops_encoding}
\end{figure}

Each ports encodes the next counterclockwise egress with the ID zero. In other words, the selected egress ID must be
calculated by taking into account the ingress id, this is a relative egress addressing.

An example of an unicast packet is given in figure \ref{hynoc_unicast_packet_example_64b}. It corresponds to the path
described in the figure \ref{hynoc_hops_encoding}, the NoC payload width is 64-bit.

  \label{hynoc_unicast_packet_example_16b}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Multicast Circuit Switch routing}

The multicast routing policy permits to target multiple egress ports at a time from a unique ingress port. The table
\ref{multicast_circuit_switch_field} describes the multicast circuit switch protcol field. For a router with P ports,
the Hop field width is $W=P-1$ bits. The index field points the correct hop to be used by the router ingress port. The
Gap width can be in $[0, W-1]$.

As a reminder, the index must be initialized to $H-1$, because the ingress port forwards the flit by decrementing the
index. A multicast flit can embed less than the maximum allowed number of hop fields by just initializing the index
accordingly.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c | c | c | c | c | c}
    \toprule
    \hline
    \textbf{Proto} & \multicolumn{5}{c}{\textbf{Hops list (K-4 bits)}} \\
    \hline\hline
    4'b0001 & Gap & Hop H-1 & ... & Hop 0 & Index \\
    \hline
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{multicast_circuit_switch_field} Multicast Circuit Switch Field Description}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Combining multiple routing policies}

Multiple types of routing flits can be mixed at the beginning of a packet.
