The HyNoC router is built upon following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Wormhole switching,
    \item Buffered (FIFO) flow control,
    \item Distributed arbitration,
    \item Fully parallel round robin in each distributed arbiter,
    \item Dedicated clock domain to each port.
\end{itemize}

A router can be delivered in a fully synchronous way, ie the router and the port use the same clock domain. For more
complex designs, the router can also be delivered with dedicated clock domains for the router itself (core clock) and
for the interfaces (ifce clocks).

A router can also be delivered with 3 to 9 interfaces, ask us for the exact topology you need. Each interface embeds a
synchonous or asynchronous FIFO with a depth configurable between 2 to 64 elements.
